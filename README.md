# Contact-Book-Application
Create a well-designed contacts application (a telephone book).

Write a ContactsMain.java file that will contain the main() method and all the UI for the program. Keep
all the I/O within this file. 

Write a ContactsTest.java file to test your contacts. It does not test ConstactsMain.java. It will have a
main() method that will run the testing software. 

Use the word “Contacts” in the class names of all additional files.
